# Profile file for the test experiment
# The format is is ID,NO_TRUSTEES,NO_TRUSTORS:[FEATURES]:[EFFORT_LEVELS=(ID,MEAN,STAND-DEV,COST)]
# A feature is a tuple consisting of an identifier and a real value in [0,1] 
# giving a probability of this profile possessing this feature
# USE MEAN=0.00 AND SD=0.00 FOR UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED BEHAVIOUR
# These profiles are each indicated by the presence of one feature and absence of the others.
