# Profile file for the test experiment
# The format is ID,TRUSTEE-COUNT,TRUSTOR-COUNT,DEFAULT-ASK-PRICE,DEFAULT-AMBIGUITY-AVERSION:[FEATURES]:[EFFORT_LEVELS]
# A feature is a tuple consisting of an identifier and a real value in [0,1] 
# giving a probability of this profile possessing this feature
# An effort level consists of an identifier, a mean, st. dev and cost to the agent
